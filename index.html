        <h1>Portfolio of Max Mullin</h1>
        <p class="desc">
            This is a portfolio for the work I did in my Digital Media Class.  I really enjoyed working with Github as it was something I haven't used before.  However, I wish we spent more time learnig how to use github as consumer as I found it hard to navigate to other students pages and wondered how people in the real world used this resource. 
            Making this website was quite fun and I would take this class again.
