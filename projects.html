        This Audio Narrative discusses Martin Luther and his rebellion against the Catholic Church. I go into detail abou thow Martin Luther rose in fame for his 95 theses aandd the Diet of Worms.  If you like history than this large conflict that resulted in many wars was largely in part to Martien Luther.
